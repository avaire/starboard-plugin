AvaIre Starboard
================

AvaIre Starboard is a simple plugin that can be used to define a starboard channel per-server, users can then react to messages using the ⭐ emoji to get messages showing up on in the starboard channel.

## How to Use

> **Note:** This assumes you're already self-hosting Ava, this plugin won't do anything on its own!

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/avaire/starboard-plugin/releases) off github and place the `.jar` file within the plugins folder.
2. Start up Ava to make Ava recognize the plugin.
3. Setup your starboard channel using the `!starboard` command.

And you're done!
